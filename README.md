# Topic-Modeling

Topics are a latent structure. They are often not explicitly called out and labeled in the document corpus. So some extra work is needed to figure out the topics. Today we will learn a powerful technique for doing this (almost) automatically!

Our goal in this module is to get hands-on experience in how to build and train a Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model using the Gensim library.

**Learning Objectives:**

At the end of the lesson you should be able to:

Part 1: Describe how a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) Model works

Part 2: Build a LDA Model with Gensim

Part 3: Interpret LDA results & Select an appropriate number of topics
